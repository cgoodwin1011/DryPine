IRL Char/Meet App

Functionality:

The purpose of this app is to facilitate spontaneous and real life social interactions between/among users. Tinder meets Meetup meets foursquare

Users login via facebook

Users join interest+location groups (i.e., moms with young kids in 19103 zipcode...)
  Users can invite (selected) FB friends to join

Users can carousel/slideshow through group members and select another user with whom to connect directly via (i) videochat (if we can get it working) or (ii) IMs (if we can't get videochat working).

Users can also post "shout outs" to entire group along the lines of "I'm going to Rival Bros. Coffee, anyone want to meet for coffee"

Users can also check into places (as with foursquare) if they want to meet up with other group members at whereever location where the initiating user is at the time.  ("Am at Rival Bros.  Anyone else here?  Want to come out?")
